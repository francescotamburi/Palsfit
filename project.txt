ratio maintained tau2/tau1 from 1.2->1.6ish

go down to 1.2 with tau2 = 180-220 for 150ps tau1

what plots to produce?
(to see where data starts to break down)

plot ratio against what?
- maybe real defect lifetime against output defect lifetime?
 - or Intensities?
 - chi sq?

excel or python?

----------------------------

single gaussian resolution with 210ps?
Vary gaussian if it looks like it's working (180ps)
plot melt test sectrum in py
use palssim to create the same spectrum (look phone)
