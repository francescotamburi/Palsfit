ratio maintained tau2/tau1 from 1.2->1.6ish

x go down to 1.2 with tau2 = 180-220 for 150ps tau1

x what plots to produce?
(to see where data starts to break down)

x plot ratio against what?
- maybe real defect lifetime against output defect lifetime?
 - or Intensities?
 - chi sq?

x excel or python?

----------------------------

single gaussian resolution with 210ps? x
Vary gaussian if it looks like it's working (180ps)
x plot melt test sectrum in py
x use palssim to create the same spectrum (look phone)

area original spectrum 26,667,763
